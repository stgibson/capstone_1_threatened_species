# Capstone 1 Project Proposal

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create a website that allows users to locate
other users in the vicinity who share a passion for protecting a certain
threatened species.

## Demographics

The target audience for this website is people who want to work with others to
help protect threatened species in their area and/or help to move the species
out of the threatened species list.

## API

The IUCN Red List API will be used for this project. This API allows servers to
request for information on the threatened level on a species. It allows for
looking up a species by its full species name, as well as for looking up a list
of species names in a given region. The regions in the API are based on specific
parts of a continent.
